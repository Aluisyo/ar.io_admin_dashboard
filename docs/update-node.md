# AR.IO Node Update Functionality

## Overview

The AR.IO Node update functionality provides automated updates for your AR.IO node Docker containers through the admin dashboard.

## How It Works

The update process follows these steps:

### 1. **Image Pull** üîÑ
- Pulls the latest Docker images for all AR.IO services
- Uses `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p ar-io-node pull`
- Checks if any images were actually updated

### 2. **Graceful Stop** ‚èπÔ∏è
- Stops all running services gracefully
- Preserves data volumes and configurations
- Uses `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p ar-io-node stop`

### 3. **Container Cleanup** üßπ
- Removes old containers to ensure clean restart
- Does **NOT** remove volumes (your data is safe)
- Uses `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p ar-io-node rm -f`

### 4. **Service Restart** üöÄ
- Starts services with updated images
- Uses `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p ar-io-node up -d`
- Ensures all services start properly

### 5. **Verification** ‚úÖ
- Checks that at least 80% of services are running
- Reports the final status to the user
- Provides detailed feedback on what was updated

## Smart Update Detection

The system intelligently detects whether updates are needed:

- **No Updates Available**: If all images are already up to date, the system reports this and skips unnecessary restarts
- **Updates Available**: If new images are downloaded, the full update process is executed
- **Partial Updates**: The system can handle scenarios where only some services have updates

## Safety Features

### Data Protection üõ°Ô∏è
- **Volumes Preserved**: All data volumes are preserved during updates
- **Configuration Safe**: Your `.env` files and configurations remain unchanged
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Services are stopped properly, not forcefully killed

### Error Handling üö®
- **Rollback Capability**: If the update fails, you can manually restart the previous containers
- **Status Verification**: The system verifies that services are running after update
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs help diagnose any issues

### Prerequisites Check ‚úÖ
- Verifies `docker-compose.yaml` exists
- Checks Docker Compose functionality
- Validates project configuration

## API Endpoint

**URL**: `/api/actions/update-node`  
**Method**: `POST`  
**Authentication**: Required (NextAuth session)

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "AR.IO Node updated successfully! 8/8 services running.",
  "details": {
    "stepsCompleted": [
      "Pulling latest images",
      "Stopping services", 
      "Removing old containers",
      "Starting updated services",
      "Verifying services"
    ],
    "servicesRunning": 8,
    "totalServices": 8,
    "imagesUpdated": true,
    "pullOutput": "core Pulled\\nredis Pulled\\n..."
  }
}
```

### No Updates Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "AR.IO Node is already up to date. No updates available.",
  "details": {
    "stepsCompleted": ["Checked for updates"],
    "pullOutput": "core already up to date\\nredis already up to date",
    "imagesUpdated": false
  }
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to update AR.IO Node",
  "details": "Docker compose file not found at /path/to/docker-compose.yaml"
}
```

## Environment Variables

The update functionality uses these environment variables from your `.env.local`:

- `AR_IO_NODE_PATH`: Path to your AR.IO node directory (default: `~/ar-io-node`)
- `DOCKER_PROJECT`: Docker Compose project name (default: `ar-io-node`)

## Services Updated

The update process affects these AR.IO services:

- **core**: Main AR.IO gateway service
- **redis**: Caching and data storage
- **envoy**: Proxy and load balancer
- **observer**: Monitoring and health checks
- **autoheal**: Container health management
- **grafana**: Monitoring dashboard (if enabled)
- **prometheus**: Metrics collection (if enabled)
- **node-exporter**: System metrics (if enabled)

## Testing

You can test the update functionality using the included test script:

```bash
node scripts/test-update.js
```

This performs a dry-run test of all update components without actually restarting services.

## Manual Update (Alternative)

If you prefer to update manually, you can run these commands in your AR.IO node directory:

```bash
# Navigate to AR.IO node directory
cd ~/ar-io-node

# Pull latest images
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p ar-io-node pull

# Restart with updated images
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -p ar-io-node up -d --force-recreate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Docker compose file not found"**
   - Check that `AR_IO_NODE_PATH` points to the correct directory
   - Verify `docker-compose.yaml` exists in that directory

2. **"Some services not running after update"**
   - Check Docker logs: `docker compose -p ar-io-node logs`
   - Some services may take time to start up fully
   - The observer service often restarts during updates

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Ensure the admin dashboard has permission to run Docker commands
   - Check that the user running the dashboard is in the `docker` group

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Review the server logs for the admin dashboard
- Use the test script to diagnose issues: `node scripts/test-update.js`

## Security Considerations

- Updates require admin authentication
- Only pulls images from official AR.IO repositories
- Does not modify configuration files
- Preserves all data and settings

*This update functionality ensures your AR.IO node stays current with the latest improvements and security updates while maintaining data integrity and minimal downtime.*
